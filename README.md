This folder contains all of the code used for my 3 projects during my MRes in Genomic Medicine at the University of Cambridge.

My projects are as follows:

Project 1 : Unveiling Genetic Drivers of Angiosarcoma: A Somatic Variant Analysis from the 100,000 Genomes Project

Project 2 : Exploration of Familial Atrial Fibrillation: utilising the 100,000 Genomes Project for Germline Variant Identification and Polygenic Risk Assessment
